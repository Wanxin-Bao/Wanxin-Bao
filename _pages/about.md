I am currently a second year PhD student at the University of Tokyo, (supervisor: Prog. [Atsushi Yamashita])(https://www.robot.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamashita/index-j.html)。 I focus on 3D reconstruction, inverse rendering.

I obtained my master's degree at the University of Tokyo and Bachelor's degree at Dalian University of Technology.
